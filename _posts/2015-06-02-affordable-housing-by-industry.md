Most affordable housing levels are based on the AMI (Average Median Income) for Buncombe County.

However, there's more to the story - many industries in Asheville pay wages far below the county-wide median, and these people have even greater difficulty finding housing in Asheville.

US Dept. of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (Wage Data): http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_11700.htm

Here's a report, used by MHO, that does what I'm suggesting - but the data is a bit out of date. We can build a tool that does the same thing, but pulls data directly from the Dept. of Labor!
