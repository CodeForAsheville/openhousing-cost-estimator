RentApply is an application that allows prospective tenants to submit a single, consolidated rental application that will offers a comprehensive evaluation of the tenant and can be reviewed by multiple property owners.

<a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-rentapply">Github repo for this project</a>
<h2>Project Information/Methodology</h2>
Behaviors:
<ol>
	<li>Renters fill out one application form and answer some general questions about what they are looking
<ol>
	<li>Criteria plus standard application
<ol>
	<li>Locations</li>
	<li>How much do I want to pay?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Landlords can view submitted applications and select potential renters</li>
	<li>Evaluations/Reviews for both tenants and landlords</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAG0829.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-168" src="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAG0829-285x300.jpg" alt="IMAG0829" width="413" height="435" /></a>

Concerns:
<ol>
	<li>Information security</li>
	<li>Equal opportunity &lt;could results be anonymous? ie. renter fills out criteria that is collected - salary/debt to income ratio etc. and presented on profile simply as range they can afford based on the results. so not based on salary.</li>
</ol>

Things to Consider
<ul>
	<li>Sublease agreements</li>
	<li>Unattractive tenants (Ex-drug users, convicted felons etc / Halfway house Listings?)</li>
	<li>Linking to Outside resources</li>
	<li>Tenant rating system</li>
	<li>Friend network referral system</li>
	<li>Communication portal for both parties where lease can be signed, documents shared etc. All parties could use for legal records later.</li>
	<li>What happens when there is no option that is affordable?</li>
</ul>
