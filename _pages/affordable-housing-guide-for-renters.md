Let's make a tool to help guide connect people in need with the correct resources.
<ol>
	<li>Ask the user for some information about their situation - household size, income level, etc</li>
	<li>Display resources that they may be eligible for</li>
	<li>Display available properties that may be affordable for them?
<ol>
	<li>If no properties exist, what else can they do?
<ol>
	<li>Shared housing?</li>
	<li>Emergency housing / shelter</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
