We want to hear from you! Have you experienced a problem that you were able to solve through public resources? Have you had a particular department come through big for you? Or had a hard time finding what options you have?

Open the google doc below and add your story.

You can help others by sharing how you overcame your housing challenges. Please include as thoroughly as possible any resources you used (ex, specific subsidies, departments, statutes, documents, or accreditations that helped you along the way).

Let's help each other find solutions by creating a knowledge base through story telling.
