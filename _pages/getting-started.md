<h2>Welcome to Open Housing Asheville</h2>
It's great to have you here! We have prepared some foundational materials to help everyone get up and running as quickly as possible. Below is a comprehensive overview of the resources we have available. Please review the following steps and materials to get started.

We are using embedded apps and google docs to allow easy collaboration. App pages will contain the embedded app, the github repo link, and an embedded google doc, as well as a brief overview.

We have broken our housing portal into three sections. The hierarchy is below:
<ul>
	<li>Need Housing? (will lead to first subpage)
<ul>
	<li>Home Seeker Decision Tree (gdoc + app/repo)</li>
	<li>Housing Cost estimator (gdoc + app/repo)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Owners/Landlords (will lead to first subpage)
<ul>
	<li>Home-owner/landlord decision tree app (gdoc + app/repo)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Advocate for Affordability (gdoc)
<ul>
	<li>Infographics (gdoc + repo)</li>
	<li>Affordable by industry (gdoc + app/repo)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>If you're a designer:
</strong>We have multiple design needs, from page layouts to infographics. You may be interested in our <a href="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/infographics-for-affordable-housing/">infographics</a> section. We will need a corresponding decision tree graphic to complement the housing decision tree apps for both <a href="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/home-ownerlandlord-decision-tree/">landlord/home-owner</a> and <a href="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/affordable-housing-guide-for-renters/housing-decision-tree/">home-seekers</a>.

<strong>If you're a real-estate professional:
</strong>We need your help determining what questions to be asked for tenants and any considerations that may help our decision-making apps for <a href="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/home-ownerlandlord-decision-tree/">home-owner/landlord</a> and <a href="http://dev-open-housing-asheville.pantheon.io/affordable-housing-guide-for-renters/housing-decision-tree/">home-seekers</a>.

We also need help finding resources for app and infographic building, we have a google doc for resources set up <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ch13fH5d5W4KyP2rcjngwwZ_Gw53QYu946aeyZhwnd4/edit#">here</a>.

<strong>If you're a developer:
</strong>We will need help building the components of the housing portal! Our main focus will be a decision tree application that will allow better access to affordable housing from both ends. We also would like to build a Twilio app that offers this service to those without computers or smartphones.

<h3><b>Slack
</b></h3>
If you're part of the Code for Asheville Slack team, post your questions, answers, comments, and ideas to our #hackforchange channel. If you're not a part of our Slack team, <a href="http://codeforasheville.org/slack">sign up here</a>!

<hr />

<h3><b>Github</b></h3>
The Code for Asheville <a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville">Github account</a> will house all of the projects we will be working on. We've added a few repositories to start, but if you'd like to add another one, we can help you push it to our Github Account.

We have added 5 repo's with project ideas that are ready for your contributions immediately:
<a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-owner-decision-tree" target="_blank">
</a>Housing decision Tree: <a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-seeker-decision-tree" target="_blank">Home Seekers</a> | <a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-owner-decision-tree" target="_blank">Home-Owners/Landlords</a>

Our main objective is to build a guided housing decision matrix that will help both home-owners/landlords and home-seekers determine the best course of action given their specific requirements. The three components of this project are:
<ol>
	<li>Determine step-by-step questions and recommendations for rental agencies/sellers, and home-seekers (great for people who want to collect data or information, and real estate experts)</li>
	<li>Create an infographic that represents the steps in the decision tree, and the flow for both home-owners and home-seekers.</li>
	<li>Build a live application that will offer recommendations on the next course based on a given set of questions (ex. "what is your income level", "what is your family situation", "do you have pets", etc.)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Other projects we have set up repo's for:</strong>

<a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-cost-estimator">Cost Estimator
</a>Great for developers who want a challenge in collecting, calculating, and displaying data.

<a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-infographics">Infographics
</a>Whether you're a designer or a statistician, get creative and make an awesome and informative infographic!

<a href="https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/openhousing-industry-affordability">Industry Affordability
</a>Help us understand how the local wage levels across different industries affect housing affordability in the area.

We'd like to version control and make publicly available as much as we can, so we're happy to help if anyone has questions about pushing their work to Github.

<h3><b>Google Docs</b></h3>
The main folder that houses everything is <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B5M7hmH7345JR3hFTjBGcm55TVE/0B0lTUpYkWIIQfno3VVVVOGNDelFWWmV0OVphT0tmZ1NsdWxVNFFLbEp0OE5Sb2NFOUs2Szg">here</a>

In addition to shared documents that we will be using to collaborate on the apps, we have also seeded this collection with some data collections.

Feel free to add new documents and make edits. Please exercise discretion when making new documentation and adding resources in order to keep as organized as possible and make sure we're not duplicating efforts.

There is a document for each app idea. If a new app is introduced, please create a google doc for it and we will create a new page in the portal and link to the project repo (we can help you create the new repo under the Code for Asheville organization).
